# Front-end Developer Nanodegree Restaurant review app
For this project I was given an unfinished restaurant review app which I had to make responsive, accessible and that it should work offline by using service workers.

This was a project part of the [Front-end Web Developer nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) with Udacity and Google. The original files for the project can be found at [Udacity's GitHub profile](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1). Here's my other [projects for fend](https://inacarine.github.io/fend).

## Instructions
To view the app, head over to this link: https://inacarine.github.io/fend-restaurant-review-app/dist/

Or you can:
1. **Download the files:** click the 'clone or download' button and chose to download the game as a ZIP file. You then need to unzip the files so you can open the index.html file in your preferred browser. You are then good to go!
2. **Using git:** You will need [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer. In the command line, run this command `$ git clone https://github.com/InaCarine/fend-feed-reader-testing.git`, and the files will be cloned to your computer. When finished, open the index.html in your browser.
